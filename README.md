The CSS file is responsible for styling the HTML elements, providing a visually appealing and responsive layout. Some key styling aspects include:

Global Styling: Resets default margin and padding, sets the background color, and defines the font family.
Navbar Styling: Ensures the navigation bar is positioned at the top, styled the logo, language dropdown, and “Sign in” button.
Hero Section Styling: Creates an overlay on the hero background image, styles the hero card with the title, subtitle, and email form.
Feature Section Styling: Styles individual feature cards with details and images, including the background videos and GIFs.
FAQ Section Styling: Styles FAQ accordions, making them visually appealing and ensuring smooth transitions.


JavaScript Interactivity:
The JavaScript file adds interactivity to the project, particularly to the FAQ section. Key JavaScript functionalities include:
